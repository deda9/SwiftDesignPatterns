# Swift4.0 Design Patterns

# Introduction
Design patterns are the best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
Design patterns can speed up the development, reusing the code and improves code readability.

# Types of Design Patterns
- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral

### Creational Design Patterns
>In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

### Structural Design Patterns
>Structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other. Or yet another explanation would be, they help in answering "How to build a software component?"

### Behavioral Design Patterns
>In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.
